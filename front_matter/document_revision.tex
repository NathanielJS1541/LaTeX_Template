% Document Revision Tracking.

% Decrement the table number before the version history table is generated, as
% it increments this counter but does not display a caption. This just makes the
% rest of the document captions start at 1 which looks neater.

% Version history table.
\begin{versionhistory}
    % To add new names to the version history table, add a macro to
    % preamble/authors.tex to link the initials here to a name. Without doing
    % this, only the initials will appear for the document authors.
    % Example entry for John Smith in preamble/authors.tex:
    \vhEntry{00.01}{1970/01/01}{JS}{Initial Draft.}
\end{versionhistory}

% Table to display information about the last git commit. If this is empty when
% the document is rendered, ensure that either preamble/vc or preamble/vc.bat
% have been run, and that preamble/vc.tex contains the correct information.
% This is not intended for true version control, more as a check that the
% revision history table above has been updated correctly.
